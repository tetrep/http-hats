TODO:
[0]	The README
[1]	//basic proxy functionality with threading
[2]	//garbage collection of dead tunnels(via reap)
[3]	static http-headers (no parsing, using buffers)
[4]	//settings derived from config file
[5]	daemon
[6]	http 1.1 compliant (or mostly compliant) server
[7]	dynamic http-headers using config file
[8]	key authentication (ideally resuing ssh keys)
[9]	dynamic tunnel exit (currently determined at start up)

POSSIBLE BUGS:
[1] exception from io_service of listening tunnel if handle is passed, object is reaped, and then handle is called, i havent looked into it fully but this appears to be possible, first step is to make sure connection is closed before killing the object, will worry about after


README:
	first arguement passed is the profile, the program will look for a file named <profile> to load settings
